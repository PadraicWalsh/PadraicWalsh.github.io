# CONTEXT: 
#         
#          
#         The dataset for the project is based on the National Basketball Association (NBA), for the period of 1996-2022. 
#         The NBA is a professional basketball league in North America, made up of 30 teams (at present), with 29 teams 
#         from the USA, and 1 team from Canada. 
#         
#         The dataset has been scraped from Kaggle (all_seasons.csv), and It contains a broad range of players stats who were 
#         registered to a NBA teamâ€™s roster for the aforementioned time period.
#         
#         The dataset contains 12,306 rows and 22 columns. Each row corresponds to a single player's stats from the time 
#         period indicated.
#         
#         OBJECTIVES 
# 
#         -To clean the new dataframe from the all_seasons.csv
# 
#         -To explore single distribution and numerical categorical features using stats & visualizations.
# 
#         -To explore the correlation of multiple features using the players stats & to plot their findings. 
# 
# 
#         The project will be very much geared towards the Exploratory Data Analysis end of things, to better understand the         dataset, and to discover any possible trends and insights.

# We can see from the plot, that James Harden has the highest points average during the period of 1996- 2022.


# CONCLUSION: 
# 
# Overall it has been a very interesting process of analysing a dataset in-depth for the first time. Certain assumptions you
# may of had prior, particularly in relation to the players physical attributes, provides us with the factual evidence to 
# support or reject the assumptions. 
# 
# Some of the functions were a lot of fun to explore with, in particular 'group by' and 'pivot table'. Their ability to drill 
# down into the data and provide you with rapid results was fascinating.
# 
# Learning this kind of code in relation to data cleaning, transforming and EDA, gives a sense of confidence to practice these
# techniques on other datasets, and the appetite to keep learning more.
